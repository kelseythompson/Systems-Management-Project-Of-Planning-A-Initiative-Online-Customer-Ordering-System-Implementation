# Hullabaloo Party Supplies (HPS) Online Ordering System Project

## Project Overview

As a Systems Analyst, I've been entrusted with the initiation of the project planning process for the introduction of a new online customer ordering system for Hullabaloo Party Supplies (HPS). In this stage, our focus is creating practicality and feasibility assessments. This proposal, presented as the Project Charter, outlines key components and insights into what to anticipate and the intended outcomes of the project.

### Problem Statement:
Hullabaloo Party Supplies (HPS) has traditionally sold to third-party vendors exclusively. However, with the shift toward serving the general public, the existing system will not suffice. A new system must guide customers through the purchase process until completion, integrating e-commerce and shipping services.

## Purpose, Goals, and Objectives

The purpose of this project is to introduce an ordering system that can successfully serve HPS's new clientele. This system should provide usability, seamless customer interactions, and high-quality customer service. The ultimate objective is to ensure a smooth and successful transition into this new business frontier.

1. The system will be externally developed as Custom Software.
2. The system will be web-based, ensuring broad accessibility.
3. The system will support integration of applicable data.
4. Robust security measures will protect customer data and prevent unauthorized access.
5. The system will be compatible across various devices and operating systems.
6. Order tracking features will be integrated for customer convenience.
